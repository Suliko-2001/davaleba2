            <p>Eunji founded Aetherfield with one goal: to help companies take climate action without waiting for a perfect plan. With a background in environmental systems and software design, she’s spent the past decade building tools that turn impact goals into real-world outcomes. She still insists on biking to every investor meeting.</p>
